## Setup

  npm install
  set HTTPS=true
  npm start

(not just `npm start`, as we need https to use a camera)

## Deploying

  npm build
  npm run deploy

## Troubleshooting

  'gcloud' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
  Make sure [gcloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads#interactive) bin stuff is in system path variable.
  E:\Program Files\Google\Cloud SDK\google-cloud-sdk\bin
